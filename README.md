Objective:

	Our goal for this project is to create a website where students can sign up and post their projects. Each user will have their own homepage where they will have a link to their GitHub account. We have used the weather API to give the user an update on the weather of the region. We have a drop-down function where users can visit another user’s homepage.  The homepage will also have a chat function where users can text with people who are logged on. We also added a function where the user can search for a gif and have it posted to the chat window. We have a leaderboard/voting page where the user can post a link to their project and view other user’s projects. Another feature we have is the ability to vote whether we like or dislike someone’s project. We have used firebase as a basis to store all information. From the user’s info in the signup page to the storing of the messages that are being sent in the global chat window.
